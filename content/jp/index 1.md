# Bilguuntushigâ€™s Digital Garden

Welcome! This is my **living collection of notes, ideas, and projects**.  
Like a garden, itâ€™s always evolving â€” some notes are seedlings ðŸŒ±,  
some are in bloom ðŸŒ¸, and others are still growing ðŸŒ¿.

## âœ¨ What youâ€™ll find here

- ðŸŒ± **Notes** â€” raw thoughts, quick connections  
- ðŸ“š **Essays** â€” longer reflections and polished ideas  
- âš™ **Projects** â€” experiments, logs, and showcases
